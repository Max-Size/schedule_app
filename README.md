# Schedule App

This project provides users an app that allow them make own schedule and edit edit this if it's necessary. It was my first Flutter project that's why I decided use the minumum of packages and build the app only with default tools SDK provides.

## Techologies
- InheritedModel - state managment
- path_provider - getting access to the directory for storing data
- flutter_slidable - fordeleting the event on slide
